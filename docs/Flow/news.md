## Feature: News

Description:

The News workflow in LeetTools helps users generate a list of the latest news items related to a specific topic from an updated local knowledge base (KB). This feature focuses on finding, consolidating, and ranking the most relevant news items, ensuring that users are kept up-to-date with the latest information. The workflow performs multiple steps to ensure that duplicate items are removed, and news items are ranked based on the number of sources reporting them.

### How it Works

#### 1. KB Check and Document Retrieval
   - The workflow checks the KB for the most recently updated documents.
   - It scans these documents to find news items, focusing on newly added or modified content.
#### 2. Combining Similar News Items
   - News items with similar content are grouped together, reducing redundancy and improving clarity.
   - The grouping ensures that multiple sources reporting the same news are combined into a single news item.
#### 3. Removing Duplicates
   - Any news items that have already been reported are removed from the results, ensuring that users only receive fresh updates.
#### 4. Ranking by Source Count
   - The remaining news items are ranked based on the number of sources reporting them. This ensures that the most widely covered news items are given higher priority.
#### 5. Generate News List
   - A final list of news items is generated, each with references to the sources where the news was reported. This allows users to access the original documents for more detailed information.
#### 6. Customization Options
   Users can fine-tune the news generation process with several parameters:
    - `days_limit`: Limit the results to news published within a specific time range.
    - `article_style`: Specify the style of the generated news items, such as "news article" or "technical blog post" (default is "analytical research reports").
    - `output_language`: Specify the language for the output of the news items.
    - `word_count`: Control the number of words in the output sections (empty means automatic).
#### 7. Result Output
   - The final output is a list of relevant news items, ranked by source count, each containing references to the original reporting sources.

### Key Benefits

- Latest News: Always retrieve the most up-to-date news from your local knowledge base.
- Duplication-Free: Duplicates are removed, so you only see unique news items.
- Source Ranking: News items are ranked by how many different sources report on them, ensuring you see the most important stories first.
- Customization: Adjust how news items are presented and filtered to meet your needs.

### Example User Case

To generate a list of the most recent news on "AI in Healthcare" from your local KB, you can run the following command:

```bash
% leet flow -t news -q "Can we trust ai in Healthcare" -k "AI in Healthcare" -l info -p days_limit=30 -p article_style="news article" -p output_language="en"

```

### Explanation

- `t news`: Specifies the News workflow.
- `l info`: Sets the log level to `info`, which provides essential log messages.
- `p days_limit=30`: Limits the news results to items published within the last 30 days.
- `p article_style="news article"`: Specifies the output style of the news items as a "news article."
- `p output_language="en"`: Outputs the results in English.
